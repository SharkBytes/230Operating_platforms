#   Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client gaming room have a game created called "Draw it or Lose it". This game has already been designed for Android devices. The client would like to expand their game to various other platforms. 
#  What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did a good job documenting constraints and requirements for the game. I also documented the pros and cons of each operating well to seperate use cases.
#  What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML diagram helped lay the foundation using the constraints outline in the design document. It clearly illustrated relationships between features and characters.
#  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve upon research skills. Providing evidence for my recommendations in the design document.
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Making your product easy to use is crucial for user retentions. Users will be more inclined to return if they have a pleasant time interacting with your product. So it is important to be mindful of the users and what they need. That is how you know a product is good.
#  How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would first look for commonality. Example in with our client The Gaming Room we know they have the game designed for Android. It would make sense if we design the extension of the game around the code and software that already exists. Creating a ease of integration in our design will speed up development time. Ensuring that the software we write will be compatible with the Android version. In this case our ideal programming language would probably be Java since it's the most likely language used to develop the app to begin with. Java is also know to be runnable crossplatform. From here we can achieve the main goal of crossplatform compatibility.
